My very own docker containers for development, reverse engineering and software analysis.


```
zsh with extensions
gh cli
binary tools (r2, binutils, binwalk...)
machine learning python libraries
netcat, ping, nmap
norminette, just in case
```

lighter alpine version available, just to get root quickly
